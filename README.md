**Abstract**
The aim of this research study is to investigate the various factors that influence the price of housing in the United States, with a particular focus on the relationship between the housing market and key economic factors such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Per Capita income, and Inflation Rate. The research question being addressed is whether there exists a significant correlation between the price of houses and these economic indicators. The study will examine data from a variety of sources, including real estate market data, economic indicators, and demographic information. The findings of this research study are expected to provide insights into the factors that affect the housing market in the US, and may be useful for policy makers, economists, and real estate professionals.

A possible hypothesis for the research question "What are the factors influencing the price of housing in the US? Is there any relationship between the price of houses and economic factors like the GDP, Per Capita, Inflation Rate etc?" could be:

Hypothesis: There is a positive correlation between the GDP, Per Capita income, and Inflation Rate and the price of housing in the US.

A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for an observation or phenomenon that can be tested through scientific research. In this case, the hypothesis proposes a potential relationship between the price of housing and key economic factors, which can be tested using statistical analysis of relevant data. By testing the hypothesis, we can determine whether or not there is a significant correlation between these variables, and if so, to what extent. 

After much research and data analysis we have came to the conclusion that the average housing cost has risen over the years which confirms our alternative hypothesis. We found that the variable that had the strongest positive correlation to the price was the year as well as the GDP. Although there were a few instances in the data where the year and average housing cost didn't correlate but in most cases it did. By understanding this information we were able to make our model be able to predict the average cost of the housing market based on the current year as well as the GDP.
