Running the code is pretty straight-forward because it is already well-commented and the variable names are descriptive enough.
Nonetheless, 
1)	Move the house_data.xlsx file to the jupyter  notebook
2)	The column names have some unnecessary spaces which are removed in one of the cells, so be careful when running the code non-linearly, since it might raise some name errors.
3)	The entire code can be run on the in Colab since it permits you not waste time installing the modules on your computer.
4)	The size of the training set is 90% and the testing set is 10%.
5)	The number of variables used for top variables is 6. (line 105). It could have been a smaller number (or bigger)
6)	For “potential_variables_values,” in line 115, 0.2 is just to extend the line left and right a little bit.
7)	Alpha value for the ridge regressions = 0.37 and for the lasso = 0.1
