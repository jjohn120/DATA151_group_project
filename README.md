**Abstract**

What is our research question? 
	Our research question is whether or not the mean housing costs have gone up in accordance to inflation or if alternative factors have caused the market to inflate artificially. We have several ways of studying this question, but for the most part we will be studying the housing prices from 1970 to 2022 in order to 1. Understand accurately what was critical to the market in the past two years, and 2. We have the entirety of the data sets available rather than a partial set that is from 2023. The main concepts are to understand what causes fluctuations in the housing market, especially in respect to COVID, and to understand the inflation rate and to see if the market is solely sheer growth of the housing market or if certain extraneous factors cause the gouge. 

What is your hypothesis and why is it important?
Our alternative hypothesis is that the mean housing cost in 2022 has increased since 2020. The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the housing cost in 2020 and 2022. This is important because it seems that housing costs have grown a lot over the past few years. And we want to see if the change in housing cost has been a reasonable change, or if it has been more than we expected. There are a lot of people looking for homes. And they will be less likely to make a purchase if the average housing cost is not what they want. Furthermore, we would like to see if the mean housing cost has increased due to bigger and more expensive houses being built, or if it is actually the average family home price is increasing. And we can see this by removing outliers. For example, if a house is worth millions of dollars, then we will remove it from our dataset because that will just increase the average cost of the housing. 

After much research and data analysis we have came to the conclusion that the average housing cost has risen over the years which confirms our alternative hypothesis. We found that the variable that had the strongest positive correlation to the price was the year as well as the GDP. Although there were a few instances in the data where the year and average housing cost didn't correlate but in most cases it did. By understanding this information we were able to make our model be able to predict the average cost of the housing market based on the current year as well as the GDP.
